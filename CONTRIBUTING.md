## Getting started

Prereqs:

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- (Optional) a virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `virtualenv`

Quick local setup (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present, otherwise `pip install django`
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the running site.

If the project uses a sample data file (for example `data/feedbacks.json`), you can use it to seed or inspect example feedback entries. There isn't an automated loader by default; you can open and inspect the JSON file directly or write a small management command to import it.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change:

```powershell
# from your fork
git checkout -b feat/short-description
```

2. Make concise, focused changes. One logical change per branch/PR helps reviewers.

3. Run tests and linters locally (see "Coding style and tests").

4. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main` with a clear title and description.

### Reporting bugs

Please open an issue using this template (title + description):

- A clear summary of the problem.
- Steps to reproduce (commands, environment details).
- Expected vs actual behavior.
- Any error messages or stack traces.
- (Optional) Suggested fix or ideas.

Attach screenshots or logs when helpful.

### Suggesting features

Open an issue titled "Feature: short description" and explain:

- Who it helps and why.
- A short proposal of how it could work.
- Any UX or security considerations.

### Working on code

- Keep changes small and scoped.
- Add tests for new behavior. A passing unit test or a short functional test is ideal.
- Document any public API or configuration changes in `README.md`.

## Development workflow

Branching:

- main: stable development branch. Open PRs against `main`.
- Use topic branches for features/fixes: `feat/xxx`, `fix/xxx`, `chore/xxx`.

Commits and PRs:

- Use clear commit messages. Prefer the present tense and keep them brief.
- In your PR description, explain the problem, the changes, and any migration or manual steps required.
- Link related issues with `Fixes #<issue-number>` when appropriate.

## Coding style and tests

- This is a Django project; follow PEP 8 and Django best practices.
- Keep views, models, and forms simple and testable.
- Use Django's test framework for unit tests (`python manage.py test`).

Suggested tools:

- isort and black for formatting (optional but recommended).
- flake8 for linting.

If you add dependencies, update `requirements.txt` if present.

## Accessibility and security

- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible form labels in templates.
- Validate and sanitize inputs; follow Django's security guidelines.
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, passwords). Use environment variables for secrets.

## Community standards

We aim to be welcoming and inclusive. Please follow these rules when interacting in issues, PRs, and comments:

- Be respectful and assume good intent.
- Provide constructive feedback.
- Report harassment or policy violations to repository maintainers.

## Where to get help

If you need help getting started, open an issue titled "Help: short description" describing what you tried and where you got stuck. Maintainers or other contributors will help triage and suggest next steps.
